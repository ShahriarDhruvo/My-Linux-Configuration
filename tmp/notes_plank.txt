This is the location of the themes for plank dock ->

~/.local/share/plank/themes

Add this feature to your existing script for getting started with any linux distro and try to get rid of the existing non usuable (Which you don't use currently) 
which comes with the manjaro minimalistic edition, I am talking about all these useless extensions preinstalled like dash to dock... :)
